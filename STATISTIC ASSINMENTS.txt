ANS-1
 
 To plot a histogram, we need to group the data into intervals, also called bins, and count the number of values that fall into each bin. Here's one possible way to group the given data:

Bin	Count
10-19	2
20-29	2
30-39	2
40-49	2
50-59	2
80-89	1
90-99	3
To create the histogram, we can draw a bar for each bin with height equal to the count of values in that bin. Here's what the histogram looks


ANS-2

 To construct a confidence interval (CI) about the population mean with known standard deviation, we can use the following formula:

CI = X̄ ± Zα/2 * (σ/√n)

where X̄ is the sample mean, σ is the population standard deviation, n is the sample size, Zα/2 is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level, and ± indicates the two-sided interval.

Given the problem, we have:

Population standard deviation (σ) = 100
Sample mean (X̄) = 520
Sample size (n) = 25
Desired confidence level = 80%, which corresponds to a two-sided critical value of Zα/2 = 1.28 (from standard normal distribution tables)
Now, we can plug these values into the formula to obtain the 80% CI:

CI = 520 ± 1.28 * (100/√25)
= 520 ± 1.28 * 20
= [494.4, 545.6]

Therefore, we can say with 80% confidence that the true population mean lies between 494.4 and 545.6




ANS-3
   
   Null hypothesis: The percentage of citizens in city ABC that owns a vehicle is greater than 60%.
Alternate hypothesis: The percentage of citizens in city ABC that owns a vehicle is 60% or less.

To test this hypothesis, we can use a one-tailed Z-test. First, we calculate the sample proportion of vehicle owners:

p̂ = 170/250 = 0.68

Next, we calculate the standard error of the sample proportion:

SE = sqrt((0.6 * 0.4) / 250) = 0.047

We can now calculate the test statistic:

Z = (p̂ - p) / SE = (0.68 - 0.6) / 0.047 = 1.70

Using a Z-table or calculator, we find that the p-value for Z = 1.70 is 0.0446. Since the p-value is less than the 
significance level of 0.10, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is enough evidence to support the idea
 that vehicle owner in ABC city is 60% or less.
 
 
 
 
 ANS-4
 
   To find the 99th percentile, we need to find the value below which 99% of the data falls.

First, we need to calculate the number of values that represent 99% of the data. We have a total of 20 data points, so 99% of the data is:

99/100 x 20 = 19.8 ≈ 20

This means that we need to find the value that is greater than or equal to 20 of the ordered data points.

The ordered data is:

2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12

Since we need the 20th value, we need to take the 20th value in the ordered data, which is:

10

Therefore, the 99th percentile is 10.




ANS-5

  In a left-skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median, which is less than the mode. In a right-skewed distribution,
  the mean is greater than the median, which is greater than the mode.

Here's a graph that illustrates the relationship between the mean, median, and mode in left-skewed and right-skewed distributions:

Left-skewed distribution:


              ________
           ___/
        ___/
     ___/
    /
   /__________________
        Mode   Median   Mean
		
Right-skewed distribution:

        ________
            \___
               \___
                  \___
                      \
   __________________\_
        Mean   Median   Mode
In both cases, the mode is the peak of the distribution (the value that occurs most frequently), the median is the value that divides
 the data into two equal halves, and the mean is the average of all the data points
